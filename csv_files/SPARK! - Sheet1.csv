 Stemness, the ability of cells to self-renew and differentiate, is a fundamental property of stem cells that has been extensively studied in model organisms. Key regulators of stemness, such as the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc), have been shown to reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, highlighting the conserved molecular mechanisms underlying cellular plasticity (Takahashi & Yamanaka, 2006). In early-diverging metazoans like Cnidarians (e.g., Hydra and Nematostella), conserved signaling pathways (e.g., Wnt, BMP) play critical roles in stem cell maintenance and regeneration, suggesting deep evolutionary origins of stemness (Watanabe et al., 2009; Juliano et al., 2014). Similarly, leeches (e.g., Helobdella austeniensis) have emerged as valuable non-model organisms for studying stem cell biology, with shared signaling pathways (e.g., Notch, Hedgehog) implicated in stem cell regulation across species (Srivastava et al., 2014; Özpolat & Bely, 2016).
 
 Despite these advances, the role of conserved protein motifs in differentially expressed genes associated with stemness remains underexplored in non-model organisms, including H. austeniensis and Cnidarians. This study aims to identify and compare these conserved motifs to uncover evolutionary conservation in stemness mechanisms. By analyzing gene expression profiles and protein sequences, we seek to elucidate how conserved molecular signatures contribute to stem cell function and regeneration across phylogenetically diverse species.
 
 To visualize the developmental context of stemness in H. austeniensis, we present a schematic cell lineage diagram tracing cellular progression from early developmental stages to stage 4c. This diagram highlights key transitions and potential stem cell populations, providing a framework for understanding the cellular basis of regeneration and differentiation in leeches.
 
 Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary conservation of stemness mechanisms and provide insights into the molecular basis of cellular plasticity across metazoans. This research has implications for regenerative medicine, evolutionary developmental biology, and the study of stem cell biology in non-model organisms.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

It is not just an environmental issue; it poses significant risks to public health, leading to unexpected health conditions. As our cities grow and industries expand, there's an urgent need for smart, data-driven solutions to monitor and predict air quality.
 This project aims to assess air quality trends and develop a model that forecasts air quality using data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collected over the last 10 years. Additionally, the project will implement explainability techniques to provide insights into the factors influencing air pollution predictions.
 The dataset includes key variables such as AQI values, air quality categories, state and county information. The EPA classifies air quality into six categories: ""Good,"" ""Moderate,"" ""Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups,"" ""Unhealthy,"" ""Very Unhealthy,"" and ""Hazardous."" The dataset consists of over three million records, with the majority falling under the ""Good"" and ""Moderate"" categories, while extreme pollution events are relatively rare. By integrating weather data, the model can account for environmental conditions that significantly impact air quality.
 To achieve accurate predictions, the project employs various machine learning and time series forecasting techniques. The models will be evaluated using performance metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) to assess their predictive accuracy. A key aspect of the project is analyzing how forecast performance degrades over time, which is crucial for understanding the reliability of long-term predictions.
 Beyond prediction, feature importance analysis will highlight the most influential factors in air pollution forecasts. Additionally, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) will be applied to individual predictions, particularly on days with unexpected spikes or dips in AQI. This approach helps us to understand why pollution levels are predicted to rise or fall.
 The findings can support proactive measures such as issuing pollution warnings, implementing emission control policies, and improving urban planning strategies. Future work can expand on this project by incorporating additional data sources, such as satellite imagery and traffic patterns to enhance predictive capabilities. In conclusion, this project contributes to the broader effort of improving air quality through data science and machine learning.",,Yes,Yes,,N,

However, research on the effectiveness of condensed SBPs remains limited, particularly concerning first-generation students.
 
 This study evaluated the student success outcomes of a four-day SBP for freshmen students at Rutgers University-Camden, measuring student sense of belonging, academic self-efficacy, and relationships with success coaches. Using a quantitative approach, the study surveyed students on these measures, comparing participants with non-participants and first-generation with continuing-generation students. Results indicated that Summer Bridge participants reported higher levels of academic self-efficacy and sense of belonging, with first-generation students benefiting the most. While statistical significance was not observed for all measures, early coach introductions were significantly associated with higher student trust. Additionally, participation in SBPs correlated with increased campus involvement.

Sleep quality is also impacted in this population, especially during hospitalization due to the artificial environment and frequent room entries. There is a need for additional research on symptom burden in patients undergoing HSCT and on the relationship of the hospital environment to sleep. There is also the possibility that symptom burden could impact patient engagement with daytime supportive care. This secondary analysis study aimed to describe symptom burden and supportive care use during the peri-transplant period and explore the effect of extending nighttime vital sign checks (EVs) to allow for a 6-hour block of sleep. This study utilized the PROMIS sleep short forms, PedsQL-Stem Cell Transplant Module, and medical chart review to assess symptom burden and supportive care use. Findings indicate that general symptom burden, as well as the severity for most individual symptoms, peaks on Day +5. Additionally, hierarchical linear modeling showed that greater sleep-related impairment predicted decreased supportive care use, and that greater supportive care use predicted reduced sleep disturbance. The EV intervention did not influence general symptom burden nor supportive care use; however, there is preliminary evidence that the intervention did reduce sleep disturbance. These findings have implications for clinical practice. Healthcare teams should monitor patients during times associated with greater symptom burden and encourage supportive care engagement to alleviate or provide distraction from symptom burden. Future studies should continue to explore the connection between symptom burden, sleep, and supportive care use, as well as investigate interventions to mitigate disturbed sleep during hospitalization.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

 Framed within a Sociocultural Theory approach to Second Language Development (Lantolf, Poehner & Swain, 2018), this proposal examines the implementation of Concept-Based Instruction (CBI) to the teaching and learning of Spanish preterite and imperfect tenses in a remote-asynchronous second semester university Spanish course. The way this course was previously designed embraced traditional structural models to the teaching and learning of Spanish, which tend to approach preterite and imperfect in a piecemeal and taxonomic fashion by which students are asked to rely on prescriptive rules and rote memorization to support their language use (Negueruela-Azarola, 2008). 
 
 To address this issue and to support online instruction in our elementary Spanish sequence, we attempted to redesign our online language curriculum by avoiding the previously mentioned structural way to teach preterite and imperfect prevailing in our current program, and implemented a concept-based approach to develop aspectual awareness and control over Spanish preterite and imperfect in a way that was more conducive towards L2 learner conceptual development (Negueruela & García, 2016). CBI moves away from memorization and repetition and supports learners in reflecting on their communicative choices by using concepts with the intent of constructing new understandings (García, 2018). 
 
 Using Vygotsky’s (1986) distinction between scientific and everyday concepts applied to L2 development (Negueruela, 2008), this poster showcases a pedagogical implementation of Concept-Based Instruction to promote L2 learner development in a remote-asynchronous context. We also examine the effectiveness of this model to the teaching and learning of the grammatical concept of aspect in a second-semester Spanish course (n=8 learners) over a two-week asynchronous sequence. Learners’ emerging L2 conceptual development is analyzed through multiple sets of developmental data, including conceptual awareness, morphological and aspectual accuracy through written narrations and cloze activities, verbalizations, personal reflection data, scaffolded activities, and the creation of personal conceptual schemas that encouraged students to manipulate and internalize conceptual distinctions rather than memorize rules. Preliminary results indicate that learners’ conscious manipulation of concepts during activity, promoted the development of a more sophisticated semantic understanding of conceptual categories, mediating in the internalization of L2 grammatical concepts such as aspect. Findings from this study indicate learners’ increased precision in the use of preterite/imperfect both morphologically and conceptually, suggesting that an asynchronous pedagogical model based on sociocultural principles can effectively promote the development of conceptual categories of meaning in novice L2 learners of Spanish.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

 Abstract:
 The U.S. airline industry has undergone significant transformations over the past two decades, with low-cost and regional carriers playing a pivotal role in shaping market dynamics. This study examines the evolution of market share and financial resilience of eight key airlines—Frontier, Allegiant, Spirit, Sun Country, Hawaiian, SkyWest, Alaska, and JetBlue—between 2003 and 2023 using quarterly data. Our analysis integrates market share trends, financial recovery patterns, and competitive clustering to provide a holistic view of industry shifts.
 
 We employ data-driven methodologies, including time series analysis, economic event correlation, and clustering techniques, to evaluate airline growth trajectories, financial robustness, and strategic positioning. The study further explores the role of geographic expansion, identifying key cities and regions that have contributed to airline success. By comparing the resilience of low-cost and regional carriers, we highlight differences in financial recovery speed and profitability trends across economic cycles.
 
 Through competitor clustering, we classify airlines based on business performance, uncovering hybrid models that blend low-cost and regional strategies. The study provides critical insights for airline executives, policymakers, and industry analysts, offering data-backed recommendations for future strategic planning. As the industry continues to evolve, understanding these historical patterns will be crucial for anticipating future growth and identifying regions poised for airline expansion.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

People from lower-status backgrounds tend to be more relationship-focused, whereas higher-status individuals prioritize individual achievement (Stephens et al., 2012; Covarrubias & Fryberg, 2015). However, less is known about how subjective and objective statuses may relate to individual values and qualitative expressions of values assessed by text analysis. Understanding more specific differences with which individual values may differ across SES can inform value-based interventions, such as value affirmation interventions, and help at-risk individuals cope with resource scarcity (Hooker et al., 2018). This study examined how subjective (perceived social status) and objective (educational background) SES may relate to the degree individuals pursue self- vs. other-related values. We also explored whether participants across different education levels expressed different kinds of values using rich text data. 
 
 A community sample of 220 individuals (mean age = 33.75 years (SD = 11.62); 144 females; 96 Black, 86 White, 16 Asian, 9 Hispanic, and 13 Other) ranked self-related (power/status, wealth, fame) and other-related (compassion/kindness, family/friends, spirituality) values, rated their importance to self on a 0-10 scale, and reported their perceived social status and educational background. A subset (n = 80) wrote about their highest-ranked value (Kang et al., 2018). Participants were categorized into three groups based on their education and their parents’ education: no-college-degree (n = 63), first-generation (n = 74), and continuing-generation (n = 83). Participants indicated their perceived social status within their community using the 10-point MacArthur Scale (Adler et al., 2007). We tested differences in self- and other-related values across educational backgrounds by regressing the mean scores of self- and other-related values on perceived social status. Using the text data, we generated word clouds to explore linguistic characteristics across educational backgrounds. 
 
 We found a significant relationship between education status and other-related values, F(2, 217) = 6.45, p = 0.002. The continuing-generation group placed less importance on other-related values than the no-college and first-generation groups, who did not significantly differ. Education was not related to self-related values. Higher perceived social status was associated with greater importance placed on self-related values (β = 0.25, t = 3.55, p < 0.001). Perceived status did not significantly relate to other-related values. Among 80 participants who described their highest-ranked value, 78 chose other-related values. “Family” was the most common word across all groups but appeared less frequently in the continuing-generation group.
 
 Findings support that personal values vary by socioeconomic background. Lower-education individuals emphasized other-related values, especially family, while higher-education individuals endorsed a broader range of other-related values. Higher perceived social status was linked to prioritizing self-related values. These findings align with research showing that lower SES individuals emphasize interpersonal values and interdependence (Carey & Markus, 2017; Snibbe & Markus, 2005). Building upon these findings, we are currently testing whether individuals’ daily value alignment - the degree to which their actions reflect the values they cherish - relate to health outcomes, using experience sampling and text data.",b,Yes,Yes,Yes,Y,

However, manually identifying posts related to mental health can be overwhelming, given the massive amount of content generated daily. This project seeks to address that challenge by using machine learning to automatically classify Reddit posts into mental health-related discussions and non-mental health topics. Additionally, the project aims to identify and categorize specific mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and PTSD, from these posts. The ultimate goal is to build a system that can effectively pinpoint mental health-related conversations and potentially help identify individuals who might need support.
 
 The dataset for this project comes from a collection of Reddit posts spanning several subreddits dedicated to both mental health and non-mental health topics. It includes posts from mental health-focused communities like r/depression, r/anxiety, r/suicidewatch, and others that cover issues such as ADHD, PTSD, and addiction. In addition, there are broader mental health subreddits like r/mentalhealth and r/COVID19_support, which discuss more general mental health topics. On the other side, there are non-mental health subreddits such as r/fitness, r/legaladvice, and r/parenting, which are unrelated to mental health but help provide a contrasting set of data to train the machine learning model. 
 
 The dataset itself is quite large, containing over 198 million words spread across 12.7 million sentences. After filtering out common stopwords (such as ""the,"" ""and,"" or ""is""), we are left with approximately 77 million meaningful words. While the dataset is imbalanced, with more posts related to non-mental health topics than mental health discussions, it still provides sufficient data on various mental health issues to train an effective model. The challenge here is to use machine learning techniques to identify which posts relate to mental health and then further classify them into specific categories, such as depression, anxiety, or addiction.
 
 To achieve this, the project employs several techniques. First, we use **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**, which help convert the text into numerical data that a machine learning model can process. TF-IDF, in particular, adjusts the frequency of words based on how rare or important they are across the entire dataset, ensuring the model focuses on the most meaningful terms. Additionally, we fine-tune a pre-trained **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** model. BERT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model that understands the context of words in sentences, making it especially useful for understanding the nuances in mental health-related discussions.
 
 In terms of data preprocessing, we use **spaCy** to clean and tokenize the data, and then store the tokenized data in an efficient format using **Pandas** and **PyArrow**. The entire process is designed to help the model learn from the text data, so it can accurately classify posts and recognize different mental health issues.
 
 The ultimate aim of this project is to develop a system that can help identify and categorize mental health discussions on social media platforms, which could be used to provide more timely interventions or support to individuals in need.",,Yes,Yes,,,

 A creative nonfiction reading

 There’s a moment in the fourth movement of Beethoven’s ninth symphony. We’ve heard the 
 melody of the Ode to Joy a few times as it’s been passed around from the bass soloist to the male choir, then the soprano and the women. Beethoven has embellished it with the quartet of singers. And it sort of ends. You think, okay, Ode to Joy done, now he’s going to move onto other stuff. He does for a while. There’s a little military-sounding jaunty march version of the song. The singers come back, but then the strings take over and it starts to sound like the Beethoven you know from the Fifth Symphony or the Sixth Symphony, the one in “Fantasia” with the Pegasus and cherubs. At around 6 or so minutes in, though, depending on your recording, or the speed of the conductor, or the orchestra’s enthusiasm, that all changes.
 
 What is technically happening at 6 and a half minutes into the fourth movement is a shift to B major, then b minor, then D major. The shift from b minor to D major is a shift from a 
 relative minor to a relative major key – they are related, the sad and happy versions of the 
 same scale. Weezer does it in Buddy Holly. Madonna does it in Like a Prayer. Turn that 
 frown upside down.

 This action research project investigates the impact of multisensory phonemic awareness activities on the early reading skills of preschool students. The study focuses on four students from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds in an urban preschool classroom. Recognizing that traditional phonics instruction often falls short for students with learning challenges, the project integrates multisensory activities such as the Sound Scavenger Hunt, Rhyming Songs, and Musical Name Chairs. These activities engage sight, sound, touch, and movement to make learning interactive and accessible. Data collection involved pre-assessments to establish baseline literacy skills, followed by structured observations of student engagement and progress during the activities. Results revealed that most students demonstrated measurable improvements in letter recognition, rhyming awareness, and phonemic identification. Students A, B, and C exhibited significant progress, while Student D showed minimal improvement, indicating the need for additional support. Engagement levels were generally high, with activities rated positively by students, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating multisensory elements. This research highlights the potential of multisensory methods to enhance foundational literacy skills, particularly for students from diverse backgrounds or with developmental challenges. By tailoring instruction to individual strengths and sensory preferences, educators can foster inclusive, engaging learning environments. These findings advocate for the broader implementation of multisensory strategies in early literacy programs to support diverse learner needs and promote academic success.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,"Since I'm presenting a creative work, there aren't as many ""findings"" to present as compared to traditional research.

 Modern data centers continuously strive to optimize energy efficiency, with storage systems playing a crucial role in power consumption. In this study, I analyze real-world IO traces (from Google) from a single-disk, single-server setup to maximize disk power savings by turning off disks when they are idle.
 
 Our research is structured into two key objectives:
 
 1) Predicting Interarrival Times for Disk Reads – We analyze interarrival times of disk read requests using historical patterns to determine if a disk can transition to a low-power state between consecutive IO requests. This involves building a lightweight predictive model that estimates the duration until the next request while minimizing overestimation errors.
 2) Application-Aware Disk Packing – Once interarrival times are effectively modeled, we explore strategies to co-locate applications on a disk to maximize disk idle periods without violating Service Level Objectives (SLOs), particularly the Time to First Byte (TTFB) threshold and also making sure that the disk is sufficiently full. 
 
 Our methodology involves:
 
  1) Extracting and filtering IO requests where disk activity occurs (i.e., cache miss).
  2) Computing disk interarrival times and idle times post-request completion.
  3) Developing a probabilistic model that predicts safe disk sleep durations based on historical patterns and time of day.
  4) Later, I will also look into employing lightweight machine learning models suited for real-time inference to minimize energy overhead.
 
 This research aims to reduce disk power consumption while maintaining performance reliability. The insights gained could contribute to efficient disk power management strategies for data centers, enabling cost-effective and energy-aware storage solutions.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,The final poster will be emailed to camgrad@camden.rutgers.edu before the April 1st deadline.

Although these interventions might be necessary in some cases, systemic racism, cultural bias, and structural barriers disproportionately expose women to nonconsensual or inadequately explained interventions. For instance, among Black women, 36% of births are via cesarean section (Huesch et al., 2015). Comparably, Hispanic women experience pressure for medical interventions, such as labor inductions and cesarean delivery, and face a heightened risk of discrimination due to language barriers (Valdez et al., 2023). Similarly, Asian women experience higher odds of cesarean delivery due to failure to progress in labor compared to White women (Okwandu et al., 2021). White women, though privileged by systemic bias, also report feeling more pressure to induce labor compared to Latina women (Declercq et al., 2020). Although there are differences in birth outcomes by race, more research is needed regarding the specific pressures that women face during labor induction, epidural use, and cesarean section and which racial groups experience heightened pressure for specific interventions. The purpose of this study is to explore racial disparities in perceived pressure for birthing interventions and to highlight how provider practices may disproportionately constrain autonomy among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White women during childbirth. We hypothesize that Hispanic, Black, and Asian women will report higher perceived pressure for medical intervention during childbirth compared to White women.

The Police Trauma Training Pilot Program recruited officers in Kensington Police District 24 for training sessions in Summer 2021 educating officers on trauma-informed policing, adverse childhood experiences, biopsychosocial aspects of trauma, and encouraging community engagement. Seven years of violent crime data from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2023, was accessed via the Philadelphia Police Department. Results show that the average number of violent crime incidents per month was estimated at 30 incidents and negligibly increased post-intervention (p = .819). All crime incidents, both violent and non-violent, in Kensington significantly decreased by roughly 5 incidents per month from an average of 1,083 (p < .000). While violent crime incidents are relatively unchanged, this analysis suggests that TIC may be more impactful for non-violent crime.

However, the underlying brain regions activated by S1PR3 that underlie this pro-social effect are not well understood. We propose that S1PR3 activates the infralimbic cortex (IL), a brain region that inhibits the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which regulates fear and social avoidance. The IL inhibits the BLA by activating inhibitory GABAergic neurons adjacent to the BLA. By quantifying the neuronal activity marker cFos, we found that the S1PR3 agonist CYM5541 increases neuronal activity in the IL following a 2-hour social interaction. Interestingly, S1PR3 also increased levels of GAD67, the rate limiting enzyme for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, in the BLA. Future work will determine whether GABAergic intercalated nuclei are active in these mice. We hypothesize that by modulating these neural pathways, S1PR3 activation promotes social interactions.

 Results: Support for OSW was positively associated with support for other carbon neutral energy sources except for nuclear power. Support for OSW was negatively correlated with the amount of time people spend at the coast, and positively associated with distance people reside from the coast. Political affiliation was a significant factor affecting support, with conservative participants exhibiting greater opposition than liberal participants.

 Abstract
 Effective learning requires not only acquiring new knowledge but also identifying and correcting misconceptions that hinder progress. NeuraLearn is an AI-powered adaptive learning platform designed to provide personalized education across multiple domains, including STEM, humanities, and technical skills. By leveraging machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and rule-based detection, NeuraLearn identifies patterns of misunderstanding in learner responses and provides targeted remediation to enhance comprehension.
 
 At the core of NeuraLearn is a misconception detection model, trained on real-world and synthetic datasets from educational forums, research papers, and expert-generated question banks. The system continuously improves by analyzing learner interactions, refining its feedback mechanisms, and dynamically adjusting question difficulty based on individual performance. Our current implementation includes structured datasets for Biology and Chemistry, enabling domain-independent expansion to any subject.
 
 NeuraLearn’s interactive features include:
 1. Error Pattern Analysis – Recognizes common misconceptions in student responses.
 2. Adaptive Questioning – Adjusts question difficulty dynamically based on learner progress.
 3. Intelligent Feedback – Provides detailed, concept-driven explanations instead of generic corrections.
 4. Gamified Learning Modules – Engages users through scenario-based challenges and real-world applications.
 5. Scalable & Extensible – Supports multiple subjects, integrating new datasets for various fields.
 
 The platform utilizes pretrained NLP models, rule-based classifiers, and custom-trained misconception detection models to generate meaningful, subject-specific insights. Unlike conventional assessment tools, NeuraLearn goes beyond right and wrong answers—it understands why mistakes happen and guides learners towards conceptual clarity.
 
 By integrating adaptive learning and error analysis, NeuraLearn aims to reduce misconception recurrence by 30-50% and improve retention rates across diverse learning domains. Future enhancements will include multimodal support (text, diagrams, videos) and integration with educational platforms.
 
 This research demonstrates the potential of AI-powered misconception detection in revolutionizing online education, paving the way for intelligent, personalized learning experiences that cater to every student's unique needs.",,Yes,Yes,,N,Our poster is already printed as it was presented at EPA last week!

 An appropriate diet is essential for preventing and managing chronic health conditions (CDC, 2024). Romantic partners are one of the strongest influences on one’s diet by influencing what their partners eat, including engaging in diet-related social control: influencing partners to eat less unhealthily, e.g., eating certain foods less frequently, eating smaller portions (Craddock, 2015). Past research on opposite-gender couples suggests that women are more likely to exert social control, whereas men are more likely to be the targets of control (August & Sorkin, 2010). Diet-related social control has been studied less frequently in sexual minority populations; findings on sexual orientation and gender differences in the frequency of social control within same-gender couples are mixed (August et al., 2016; Markey et al., 2016; Umberson et al., 2018). Social control meaning and frequency differ in the context of chronic health conditions (Rook et al., 2010).
 
 The present study aimed to understand how frequently romantic partners receive diet-related social control, what specific aspects of unhealthy eating their partners comment on, and how different chronic health conditions requiring changes to diet were related to social control frequency. In addition, we examined how diet-related social control experiences varied by gender and sexual orientation.
 
 Method
 Cross-sectional data from two Prolific studies of individuals in long-term romantic relationships were analyzed (Total N = 833; Study 1, individuals in opposite-gender relationships, n = 444; Study 2, individuals in same-gender relationships, n = 389).
 
 Survey questions assessed social control frequency (1 = “never,” 5 = “more than once a day”), aspects of eating commented on, and presence of chronic health conditions (diabetes, heart issues, hypertension, liver disease, stomach ulcers).
 
 Results
 The mean for diet-related social control frequency ranged from 1.87 to 2.40 (SDs = .93-1.02) for all participants. Results from 2-way ANOVAs revealed a significant interaction between gender and sexual orientation in diet-related social control frequency (F (1,828) = 13.17, p < .001); men in opposite-gender relationships reported receiving the most frequent diet-related social control, whereas women in opposite-gender relationships reported receiving the least frequent diet-related social control. 
 
 Significant interactions between gender and sexual orientation emerged in predicting comments about fast food (p = .003), fat (p = .02), how often unhealthy foods are eaten (p = .04), and substituting unhealthy foods for unhealthy ones (p = .002). 
 
 In regression analyses that controlled for BMI and race/ethnicity, we found significant associations between having diabetes (beta = .09, p = .007) and heart disease with more frequent diet-related social control; the latter finding was moderated by gender (beta = .10, p =.02), such that the effect was stronger for women than men. 
 
 Conclusion
 These findings underscore the complexity of diet-related social control dynamics and the role of both relational and health-related factors. They highlight the need for future research to further explore the nuances of social control within diverse relationship contexts. Such research could inform interventions aimed at promoting healthier eating while considering the unique relational dynamics and individual preferences within romantic partnerships.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

I use process tracing to gather data from the U.S. Senate Lobbying Disclosure and congressional testimonies to track tech sector lobbying related to immigration and subcontracting employment structures. I find that tech companies play a role in shaping their labor pool in two ways. First, through immigration lobbying, where companies simultaneously push for decreased barriers for specialty visa holders and an increase in border security and surveillance. Second, tech companies lobby to ensure that gig workers remain subcontractors who lack employee benefits and bargaining rights. My findings demonstrate that tech companies use complex strategies to reconstruct who can and cannot work and what labor protections are available. These activities grow the tech labor pool but also increase worker precarity. This study has important implications for reducing migrant labor exploitation and the future of labor in tech.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

Stoichiometric variation influences physiological, biochemical and anatomical traits affecting organismal performance in different environments. However, our understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of stoichiometric variation in animals along environmental gradients is limited. To fill this gap, I have studied the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting tank bromeliads along a spatial gradient that varies in environmental conditions. We quantified macroinvertebrate stoichiometry (%C, %N, %P) from ten sites and assessed relationships with temperature, nutrient deposition, and trophic group (carnivores vs. detritivores). We tested multiple, non-exclusive hypotheses: (i) the nutrient supply hypothesis, which predicts a positive correlation between nutrient availability and organismal elemental content; (ii) the climate physiology hypothesis, which suggests that higher temperatures at lower latitudes drive changes in growth rates and elemental composition; and (iii) the latitudinal niche-breadth hypothesis, which posits that tropical macroinvertebrates exhibit smaller stoichiometric niches and lower niche overlap due to increased environmental stability. We further examined whether community-level stoichiometric variation is driven by species turnover or intraspecific plasticity and analyzed the structure of stoichiometric niches using a multidimensional hypervolume approach.",,Yes,Yes,,N,

The purpose of this experience is to give students knowledge and strategies for success during their first semester in college and beyond, hosting activities that build competencies aligned with the SAS division’s values: a sense of belonging, academic responsibility, identity consciousness, and self-efficacy. Typically, the evaluation of the impact of this type of program focuses on standard metrics for success, such as retention and first-year GPA. In this pilot study, we focused on psychological adjustment and flourishing indicators instead. At the end of their first Fall term, we surveyed Summer Bridge participants on how engaged they were in the Program and how much they felt like they belonged in the Summer Bridge program. We also assessed the following indicators of psychological adjustment and flourishing in the survey: college meaning, hope, existential isolation, and academic self-efficacy. Preliminary findings suggest that engagement and belonging in the Summer Bridge program were associated with finding meaning/purpose in college, stronger hope, reduced feelings that others do not share your subjective experience (i.e., existential isolation), and greater belief in one’s ability to do what it takes to succeed in college (i.e., academic self-efficacy). Finally, we asked students to write about what they enjoyed about the Summer Bridge Program and how they benefited from it. In addition to naming new connections a key outcome, students reported campus navigation and wayfinding as memorable program components contributing to place-based physical belonging.

 function, structure is not directly accessible from the genome for all proteins.
 Predicting or interpreting the effects of mutations often requires identifying the local
 sequence context. Since protein structures are modular, the “local sequence” is
 frequently determined by the local secondary structure element. Some proteins, such
 as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), can only be analyzed using their sequences.
 In cases like these, detecting innate modularity independent of secondary structure
 elements using only residue-level properties such as hydrophobicity and charge is
 extremely valuable. We have previously used contiguous hydrophobicity
 (“blobulation”) to detect local sequence context for analysis of disease-associated
 mutations[1]. Here, we detail the blobulation algorithm and demonstrate its ability to
 detect subsequences associated with hydrophobic environments (core of a globular
 protein, transmembrane helices, etc.) We also present results from a coevolution
 analysis showing that these hydrophobic subsequences (“blobs”) have evolutionary
 significance. We find that pairs of similarly hydrophobic blobs are enriched for
 coevolving residues. Additionally, we find that within these blobs, the types of
 coevolving amino acid pairs change depending on the blob containing them,
 suggesting that blobulation provides a meaningful framework for defining the context
 around coevolving pairs and could be useful in further coevolution studies.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

Black adults face heightened psychological distress due to systemic racism, yet often experience lower rates of formal diagnoses and treatment compared to White adults (White, 2019; Watkins & Johnson, 2018). Similarly, Latino individuals encounter high lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders but are hindered by stigma and cultural norms that discourage help-seeking (Alegría et al., 2007; National Alliance on Mental Illness., 2024). Black and Latinos are disproportionately represented among individuals of low socioeconomic status, who also have a heightened risk of poor mental health (Belle & Doucet, 2003). Interpersonal experiences including social support, interpersonal violence, and loneliness significantly influence mental health. Social support can serve as a protective factor for depressive and anxious symptoms, while negative experiences, such as interpersonal violence, and loneliness, may put individuals at risk for these symptoms (Acoba, 2024; Resnick et al., 1997; Richardson et al., 2017; Umberson et al., 2020; Watkins & Johnson, 2018). Loneliness may be a particularly important predictor of mental health symptoms. Despite existing research on these factors, comparative studies examining how these interpersonal experiences differ between Black and Latino populations are scarce. This study aims to address this gap by identifying the associations between these experiences and mental health outcomes among low-income Black and Latinos throughout adulthood.
 
 Methods: Participants included 452 Black (n = 343) and Latino (n = 109) adults recruited from Camden, NJ. Key variables included social support, interpersonal violence, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxious symptoms. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests and hierarchical regression models, adjusting for income. Moderation analyses were conducted to examine whether race/ethnicity influenced the associations between interpersonal experiences and mental health outcomes.
 
 Results: Findings revealed significant associations between interpersonal experiences and mental health outcomes. Loneliness was the strongest predictor of both depressive (B = 0.52, p < .001) and anxious symptoms (B = 0.62, p = .001). Interpersonal violence was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (B = 0.72, p = .01) but not anxiety. Social support did not significantly predict either outcome. Moderation analyses showed that race/ethnicity significantly influenced the relationship between interpersonal violence and anxiety symptoms (B = 0.19, p = .007), with interpersonal violence being a stronger predictor for Black participants. Simple slope analyses confirmed that interpersonal violence significantly predicted anxiety for Black participants (B = 0.10, p = .001), but not for Latinos (B = -0.09, p = .14). No other significant moderating effects of race/ethnicity were observed.
 
 Conclusion: These findings contribute to an understanding of the role of interpersonal experiences in mental health outcomes among Black and Latino individuals. The results suggest that loneliness and interpersonal violence are particularly relevant interpersonal experiences in understanding mental health. These findings could inform the development of culturally tailored interventions aimed at addressing loneliness and interpersonal violence to reduce mental health disparities. Future research should further explore the mechanisms through which these interpersonal experiences may affect mental health and investigate interventions that can mitigate these challenges",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

The basic tenet of this approach is to examine how people detect a signal (such as recognizing one's own name) from background noise (chatter at a party). One of the basic assumptions of SDT is that people accurately learn the nature of a signal from inductive experience (such as a lifetime of hearing one's own name.) But this assumption has not been adequately tested as most studies of SDT assume people learn such information in an accurate and unbiased way. In the present study we use lines that differ in length as a mechanism for establishing whether or not people learn distributional aspects of a signal to discriminate from noise in a way that provides maximum accuracy. Across two experiments we find that people do not demonstrate the kind of inductive learning that most SDT models propose.

Two hundred and twenty-five participants from a university in the Northeastern U.S. (Mage = 20.03; 71.2% women) completed assessments of their awareness and interest regarding GLP-1s using questions developed specifically for this study. Participants also completed measures of body appreciation, body neutrality, self-objectification (body shame and surveillance), weight bias, concerns about weight, and attempts at weight loss; they self-reported their height and weight. Results indicated that participants who were most interested in trying GLP-1s and willing to tolerate their common side effects reported greater body shame, body surveillance, weight concerns, anti-fat bias, disordered eating behaviors, and higher BMIs, as well as lower body appreciation and body neutrality. Simultaneous regression analyses revealed that BMI and recent attempts at weight loss uniquely accounted for variance in interest in GLP-1 use and willingness to tolerate side effects of GLP-1s.

It was unclear how a small, charge-neutral mutation would affect the conformation or function of the BDNF prodomain, a long intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). Our lab aimed to determine the mechanism behind the conformational shift in the mutated protein (M66). We discovered that this effect is due to the special nature of Met-Met interactions within the protein. This raised the question whether other charge-neutral mutations at site 66 affect the conformation of the BDNF prodomain, or if our results were specific to M66. Here, we present the analysis of 2 μs all-atomistic, explicit solvent, temperature replica-exchange molecular dynamic simulations of the wild-type BDNF prodomain (V66) and mutated BDNF prodomains that contain a charge-neutral, hydrophobic mutation at position 66 of the amino acid sequence (A66, I66, L66, F66, Y66, and M66). We found that, in addition to M66, F66 also increases the radius of gyration of the entire protein, while A66, I66, L66, and Y66 decrease it compared to V66. We also applied our Blobulation method to the BDNF prodomain and found unique interactions between contiguous regions of hydrophobicity. This method was key to identifying the mechanism behind the conformational effects due to M66. These findings demonstrate that the conformational changes in the BDNF prodomain due to the mutations are not specific to M66 and extends to other charge-neutral amino acid mutations. Our results suggest that even IDPs are sensitive to specific interactions between non-aliphatic, hydrophobic residues, which can detectably shift the ensemble toward a more globular conformation.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

This study examined whether sex/gender moderated the associations between ten widely studied ACEs or IPV with mental health problems among adults who had been homeless. Methods: Data were used from participants in wave II of the NESARC who identified as experiencing homelessness (n=1,026). Logistic regression models assessed the main effects of ten ACEs individually or IPV on lifetime mental health problems (i.e., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder [AUD], drug use disorder [DUD], and nicotine dependence) and attempted suicide while controlling for age and education. Results: Sex/gender moderated 13 0f 77 (17%) associations among adults experiencing homelessness. For most (i.e., 10) of the associations that were moderated by sex/gender, ACEs were associated with greater odds of mental health problems among men. For example, witnessing maternal IPV was associated with at least twice greater odds of alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, and attempted suicide among men..

Aquatic and terrestrial habitats impose distinct selective pressures on organismal elemental content, yet the stoichiometric responses of coexisting terrestrial and aquatic autotrophs along broad environmental gradients remain underexplored. We investigated stoichiometric variation (C, N, P, and their ratios) of tank bromeliads and their associated algae along a latitudinal gradient on the coast of Brazil. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (i) What is the extent of interspecific and intraspecific stoichiometric variation between terrestrial and aquatic autotrophs? (ii) Is elemental variation in bromeliads and algae (i.e., among sites) structured along geographical gradients of climate and nutrient availability? (iii) How do elemental niches of these autotrophs shift with latitude?
 Our results reveal that bromeliads exhibit higher carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen content compared to algae. Phosphorus content in bromeliads decreases with increasing latitude, suggesting that environmental gradients influence elemental allocation. Furthermore, species niches for elemental content in both bromeliads and algae shift along latitudinal gradients, as well as in response to change in nitrogen and phosphorus deposition. These patterns indicate that environmental variability drives differences in stoichiometry between coexisting autotrophs, reflecting adaptive responses to climatic and nutrient conditions. Understanding how geographical gradients influence autotroph stoichiometry and niche dynamics is essential for predicting vegetation responses to ongoing global change.

However, controllably releasing cargo on-demand remains a challenge when implementing these vesicles in applications such as drug delivery. The self-assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers into vesicles results in the formation of two compartments: an aqueous lumen which allows for the incorporation of hydrophilic cargo, and a bilayer membrane with a hydrophobic region which can encapsulate non-polar cargo. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been shown to act as photosensitizers in response to pulsed laser irradiation, allowing for light-responsive membrane disruption and subsequent cargo delivery. In this work, two pathways of AuNP incorporation into nano-polymersomes are investigated. In one method, dodecanethiol-functionalized AuNPs are shown to partition into the hydrophobic region of the bilayer membrane of polybutadiene-b-polyethylene oxide nano-polymersomes during self-assembly. It is shown that the concentration of AuNPs present during vesicle self-assembly influences a variety of characteristics such as vesicle size, percent membrane fill, and resistance to surfactants. Furthermore, the concentration of AuNPs correlates with membrane disruption as a function of laser pulse energy, suggesting that greater AuNP concentration increases membrane disruption upon irradiation. The second AuNP incorporation method requires the insertion of a cholesterol membrane anchor to tether desired structures such as AuNPs to the exterior of the polymersome via DNA hybridization. Cholesterol is shown to successfully insert into the polymer membrane both before and after vesicle self-assembly and the amount of cholesterol accepted into the membrane is shown to scale with concentration. The dual purpose of the polymer membrane as both a compartment and an anchoring region may provide a pathway to greater control over both the size and location of AuNPs in these promising photosensitive polymersome cargo delivery systems.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

 Over the past ten years, the number of cryo-EM structures with partially resolved lipids has increased dramatically. Lipid binding sites may be important both for native protein function and as potentially drugable sites. Although cryo-EM data can indicate the presence of ordered lipids, those lipids are rarely identifiable from the density alone. We use our Streamlined Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation protocol (SAFEP) for computationally estimating free energies of phospholipid binding (Gbind) to identify lipids and compare affinities across sites and protein conformations. There are several challenges posed by the binding of phospholipids to membrane proteins: 1) lipid flexibility makes traditional restraint schemes less effective, 2) slow relaxation of lipids slows convergence of the free energy estimates, and 3) lipid-water phase separation necessitates careful interpretation of any lipid Gbind. Addressing the first two issues required simple, but highly designed restraints combined with thorough sampling. The phase separation of the system was addressed theoretically by framing the results in terms of binding probabilities - leaving any “standard” binding free energy as an intermediate result. Convergence of all calculations was monitored by several metrics as any one metric was been found to be fallible. We use lipid binding by Erwinia Ligand-Gated Ion Channel (ELIC) as a model system. ELIC is a GABA-activated, prokaryotic member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) protein family. Like other pLGICs, ELIC is known to be modulated by its lipid environment through unknown mechanism(s). By a combination of relative and absolute binding free energy calculations we were able to identify a partially resolved lipid as POPG, determine that POPC is a non-binder to the site, POPE can compete for the site at higher mole fractions, and POPG binds with greater affinity to the open conformation of ELIC.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

Spider egg sacs are multifunctional membranes that protect eggs and spiderlings from the external environment, but past research gives conflicting results about whether or not these mats of silk fibers can reduce evaporation of water in part because the diffusive resistance of any membrane cannot easily be measured independently of the system in which it is studied. We develop a model to describe water vapor transport across porous surfaces that reveals that the diffusive resistance across the gap space underneath the membrane and the boundary layer on the outside of the membrane can play much greater roles in controlling water vapor flux compared to diffusion across the membrane itself. The model accurately predicts diffusive resistance of a variety of synthetic surfaces from empirical studies, as well as the egg sacs of Latrodectus hesperus and Argiope aurantia. We show that “typical” spider egg sac membranes offer surprisingly low diffusive resistance to water because they are highly porous at microscopic scales. However, silk egg sacs still play key roles in controlling water loss by separating the diffusive resistance of the interior of the egg sacs from the outside boundary layer. Our model provides both a tool to explore diverse egg sac geometries and to facilitate comparison of diffusive resistance across membranes studied in diverse systems.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,I do have a disability.

As biotechnology and medical development evolves there is a growing need for a bioinspired healing design and materials approach for applications in therapeutics, synthetic biology, and tissue engineering. 
 
 Biomaterials are not only frequently benign to life but with an increase in implantable medical technology the fields of chemistry, biology, and engineering find themselves facing similar problems life evolved to overcome, namely a lack of durability and requirement for repair. 
 
 These devices can be made more resilient by understanding the chemical properties and molecular mechanisms of these self-healing biomaterials.

The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of robust modeling approaches that account for urbanization, population demographics, travel behavior, and migration patterns. Commonly used models include Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), which captures individual-level heterogeneity and complex interactions, and Equation-Based Modeling (EBM), which efficiently handles large-scale aggregate data. However, ABMs can be computationally intensive, and EBMs may oversimplify nuanced interactions.
 
 To address these challenges and improve city resilience to epidemics, we propose the development of a hybrid city planning tool that hierarchically integrates ABM and EBM methodologies. This tool uses two primary data sources: city sociodemographic data to simulate agent-based urban mobility patterns, and virus-specific parameters (e.g., infection rates, recovery rates, severity factors) to model epidemic propagation. Additionally, probabilistic methods are incorporated to manage data uncertainties, such as missing data points or irregularly occurring travel patterns, ensuring robust and reliable predictions.",,Yes,Yes,Y,Y,"I am an undergraduate student and am presenting at the Graduate Poster Exhibit because I cannot attend CURCA.

It is a multifaceted role that requires an understanding of diverse academic backgrounds, individual writing needs, and a range of cognitive abilities. The aim of this handbook is to explore the various challenges that writing consultants face and how they can effectively address these challenges to enhance the student experience. The Writing Center Handbook serves as both a guide for writing consultants and a resource for students, providing advice and strategies that directly stem from real-world, data-driven experiences. Drawing upon a corpus of 2.5 years of data logs from writing consultations, this thesis identifies six common challenges faced by writing consultants and provides specific recommendations for how to address them. These challenges were chosen based on recurrent themes and trends within the data, providing a practical, evidence-based foundation for the handbook’s advice. By analyzing these logs, the handbook identifies key moments within consultations—such as when students struggle with clarity, thesis development, or organizational issues—and offers detailed strategies for tackling these issues effectively. The inclusion of Skill Sheets in the handbook is a key innovation. These worksheets serve as tools for consultants to guide students through complex topics and help solidify concepts after the consultation. Each Skill Sheet is designed with a “Next Steps” section, encouraging the development of a personalized plan for each student’s writing process. This aspect of the handbook, backed by data, demonstrates how follow-up strategies can significantly improve student productivity and increase the likelihood of students returning for future sessions. The Writing Center Handbook provides a dual purpose: it supports writing consultants in navigating the challenges of their role while simultaneously fostering the academic growth of students. This resource was built with both immediate and long-term outcomes in mind, ensuring that writing consultants are equipped with the tools and strategies needed for success. By synthesizing data-driven findings with practical advice, this handbook becomes an indispensable guide for anyone entering the world of writing consultation.",,Yes,Yes,,N,

This poster examines two projects aimed at increasing lung and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Southern New Jersey leveraging provider education, patient navigation, and process improvements to address screening barriers and increase knowledge.
 The pilot project included a lung training program that was implemented to enhance lung cancer screening rates by educating ordering physicians and nurse navigators. Over the course of the study, 203 individuals (102 male, 101 female) underwent lung cancer screenings, while 55 individuals declined participation. Following the training, referrals to the Quit Center increased dramatically from 45 to 165, with 59 patients completing assessments. A lung navigator facilitated scheduling improvements, demographic-targeted outreach, and direct provider appointment access. The introduction of a Shared-Decision Making (SDM) DotPhrase in the electronic medical record (EMR) system streamlined documentation, ensuring compliance with screening guidelines. These interventions resulted in a significant increase in lung cancer screenings, demonstrating the effectiveness of workflow optimizations and provider education in encouraging preventative screenings. However, the population was not diverse or representative of the Southern New Jersey population. 
 Building upon these insights, there is an ongoing colorectal cancer screening project focuses on high-risk, underserved populations, including Black, Hispanic/Latino, Nanticoke-Lenni Lenape, undocumented, uninsured, and low-income individuals. This multi-level study aims to improve CRC screening rates through patient navigation and provider education at clinical sites in Southern New Jersey. The current CRC study employs surveys and focus groups to assess barriers to screening and the impact of provider training on screening completion rates. The project’s primary objectives include surveying current providers on CRC eligibility criteria and screening tools, surveying current medical students at Rowan School of Medicine pre and post education, surveying and conducting focus groups with community members on their experiences, perspectives, barriers and knowledge surrounding CRC screening. 
 This work highlights the importance of structured provider education, patient navigation, and enhanced outreach strategies in increasing screening rates and facilitating early cancer detection. However, more research and sustained efforts are crucial to address persistent disparities. While progress has been made, some of this work is ongoing and must continue to evolve to meet the needs of the South Jersey community. There is an urgent need for increased funding, policy advocacy, and community engagement to ensure preventative cancer screenings reach all eligible individuals, particularly in historically underserved areas. Future efforts must scale provider training, expand patient navigation programs, enhance culturally competent community outreach, and advocate for policy changes that support screening accessibility. Without continued research and investment in preventative screenings, high-risk populations in Southern New Jersey will remain disproportionately affected by late-stage cancer diagnoses and poorer health outcomes.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,"I was awarded the Graduate School Travel & Research Grant on March 11, 2024, and may require reimbursement after the poster exhibition."

While various studies have explored this issue, research specifically focused on OECD European countries remains limited. This study examines how the quality of democracy moderates the impact of health expenditure on health outcomes using a fixed effects model. A panel dataset covering 27 OECD European countries from 2000 to 2015 is constructed, drawing data from sources including the Economist Group, Global Welfare, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, and the OECD. Democracy quality is measured using the Democracy Index developed by the Economist Group, which consists of five key components: electoral process and pluralism, functioning of government, political participation, political culture, and civil liberties. Health expenditure, the main independent variable, is assessed as domestic general government healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP, while health outcomes—the dependent variables—include life expectancy at birth, number of hospitals per million population, number of physicians per 1,000 population, pharmaceutical sales, and perceived health status. By analyzing both the overall Democracy Index and its individual components, this study provides a nuanced understanding of how democracy quality moderates the relationship between health expenditure and health outcomes, offering insights into the role of governance in shaping public health effectiveness.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,

 Persistent-poverty and distressed communities are in many ways the epitome of left-behind places. Seemingly detached from the nation’s broader economic growth, the question becomes, how can residents establish or gain a “right to the city” in distress? Using a community-engaged framework, this study aims to explore this phenomenon by investigating community well-being and quality of life in Camden, New Jersey – a city that has been insolvent since 1985. Using quality of urban life indicators, we seek to answer the research question: “How do objective, subjective, and behavioral quality of life indicators influence community well-being in a distressed city?” To achieve this, we apply a mixed-method approach that merges GIS with both objective and subjective spatial data, comparative economic well-being data, and residents' subjective assessments gathered from focus groups and surveys to pinpoint areas of growth, strength, and potential improvement. We find that community well-being and certain key quality-of-life indicators are necessary to realize the """"right to the city"""" because they encompass the multidimensional aspects of residents' lives that make a city livable, equitable, and democratic. We conclude by providing strategies for community building and policy interventions that help make the right to the city possible in even the most distressing of contexts.""",N/A,Yes,Yes,,Y,

The capability to control cargo release from these vesicles with high spatiotemporal precision would be transformative for biological systems. One method to achieve this is through a light-responsive nano-polymersome system, where pulsed laser irradiation can be utilized to induce membrane disruption and subsequent cargo release. Light-responsive nano-polymersomes can be formed by incorporating dodecanethiol-functionalized gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles serve as optimal photosensitizers due to their strong interactions with light, stemming from their surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The interaction between light and free electrons results in the thermomechanical release of energy, which causes membrane disruption. Previous research has demonstrated the capacity of photosensitized micron-polymersomes and nano-polymersomes to enable controlled cargo release in response to pulsed laser irradiations. Nano-polymersome uptake and toxicity were investigated in NIH 3T3 cells, along with bulk picosecond irradiations of cells containing endocytosed polymersomes. The uptake of nano-polymersomes was analyzed using confocal microscopy with fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Polymersomes were incubated with cells that were subsequently stained with either NucBlue or Cellmask and imaged with a z-stack to confirm the endocytosis of polymersomes. The toxicity of polymersomes was assessed by incubating NIH-3T3 cells with a concentrated polymersome solution and utilizing an LDH assay post-incubation to evaluate potential toxicity. Methods were developed for cell irradiations using a 532 nm picosecond laser, and cytotoxicity was studied as a function of irradiation energy. Additionally, irradiations of cells with endocytosed doxorubicin-loaded polymersomes doxorubicin were performed. These studies suggest that polymersomes are readily uptaken into NIG 3T3 cells with minimal toxicity. Additionally, it was demonstrated that picosecond laser irradiation of cells in the absence of vesicles also results in minimal toxicity. Finally, cytotoxic doxorubicin was successfully released upon irradiation from uptaken vesicles as demonstrated by cell death.",,Yes,Yes,,Y,
